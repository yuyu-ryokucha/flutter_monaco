# Changelog

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [1.2.1] - 2026-01-08
### Fixed
- Publish workflow now uses GitHub OIDC via the official Dart publish workflow.

## [1.2.0] - 2026-01-08
### Added
- `MonacoAction` registry with comprehensive Monaco 0.54.0 action IDs for type-safe `executeAction` calls.
- Test utilities for platform WebView and controller bootstrapping (`PlatformWebViewController`, `MonacoController.createForTesting`).

### Changed
- Unknown language/theme IDs now default to `markdown` and `vsDark` respectively.
- Controller bootstrapping and WebView initialization now use a unified platform adapter with safer lifecycle handling.

### Fixed
- `executeAction` now tries `editor.getAction(id).run()` first, then falls back to `trigger` for broader action support.
- Asset extraction now reports incomplete copies and resets initialization state after failures.

## [1.1.1] - 2025-11-16
### Changed
- Bundled Monaco Editor updated to **v0.54.0** (latest stable drop from Microsoft). Existing apps automatically pick up the new assets on next launch.

## [1.1.0] - 2025-11-16
### Added
- Full IntelliSense bridge: JavaScript hooks + `MonacoController.registerCompletionSource` / `registerStaticCompletions`.
- Strongly typed completion models (`CompletionItem`, `CompletionList`, `CompletionRequest`, `CompletionItemKind`, `InsertTextRule`).
- README + example updates showing how to source completions from snippets or remote services.

### Fixed
- Export ordering and analyzer fixes to keep the public API clean.

## [1.0.0] - 2025-09-15
- Reliable typing after route/app switches on macOS/Windows — no right‑click needed.
- Optional `MonacoFocusGuard` to auto‑restore focus on resume/route return.
- New guide: doc/focus-and-platform-views.md with best practices and snippets.
- Sensible defaults: word wrap ON, minimap OFF, consistent across APIs.

## [0.1.0] - 2025-08-16
