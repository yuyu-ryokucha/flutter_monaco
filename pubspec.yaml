flutter:
  assets:
    # Adding a trailing slash (e.g. assets/images/) only includes the files
    # directly inside that directory. It does NOT include subdirectories
    # or their contents.
    #
    # Flutter does not support recursive asset inclusion. If you have
    # nested directories and want to include their assets as well, you must
    # list each subdirectory manually.
    #
    # Flutter's asset loader is non-recursive, so every subdirectory that
    # contains files must be listed explicitly. The new Monaco 0.54.0 drop
    # flattens most bundles directly under vs/, so we only need to include the
    # directories that still contain nested files.
